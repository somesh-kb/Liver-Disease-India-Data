# Indian-Liver-Patient-Dataset

This dataset is publicly available on UCI-ML. The link for the data is:- https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/ILPD+(Indian+Liver+Patient+Dataset)
The related publications are also provided on the UCI-ML page. 

The objective is to classify the a patient into a "sick" or "normal" category based on certain features. 
Main focus is in on the feature selection and hyperparameter optimization. For the latter, I have used RandomizedSearch and BayesianSearch method.
Two metrics viz. classification report and confusion matrix have been to quantify the result.
